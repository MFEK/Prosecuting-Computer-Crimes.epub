      <p class="block_34"><span class="text_51"></span><span class="text_8"> This manual focuses only on the prosecution of criminal offenses. For more on law enforcement’s access to information concerning communications, see U.S. Department of Justice, </span><span class="text_9">Searching and Seizing Computers and Obtaining Electronic Evidence in Criminal Investigations</span><span class="text_8"> (Office of Legal Education 2009). In addition, in keeping with this manual’s focus on computer crime, this chapter highlights Title III’s applicability in that context and does not address every type of case covered by the Act. Section 2511(1)(b) applies only to certain interceptions of oral communications, i.e., communications that are “uttered by a person” and are not electronic communications. </span><span class="text_9">See</span><span class="text_8"> 18 U.S.C. § 2510(2) (definition of “oral communication”). Accordingly, section 2511(1)(b) generally will not apply to network intrusions, which almost always involve electronic communications, and that section is not discussed here. </span></p>
