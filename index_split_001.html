  <p class="block_10">This manual examines the federal laws that relate to computer crimes. Our focus is on those crimes that use or target computer networks, which we interchangeably refer to as “computer crime,” “cybercrime,” and “network crime.” Examples of computer crime include computer intrusions, denial of service attacks, viruses, and worms. We do not attempt to cover issues of state law and do not cover every type of crime related to computers, such as child pornography or phishing. </p>

  <p class="block_10">This publication is the second edition of “Prosecuting Computer Crimes” and updates the previous version published in February 2007. During the three years since then, case law developed and, more importantly, Congress significantly amended the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. </p>

  <p class="block_10">Like the first edition of this manual, the revisions contained in this edition of the manual are the result of the efforts and knowledge of many people at CCIPS. Scott Eltringham edited and published it under the supervision of John Lynch and Richard Downing. Substantial assistance was provided by Mysti Degani, Jenny Ellickson, Josh Goldfoot, and Jaikumar Ramaswamy, all of whom took lead responsibility for revising one or more chapters. </p>

  <p class="block_10">We are grateful to Ed Hagen and the Office of Legal Education for their assistance in publishing this manual and the prior edition. </p>
