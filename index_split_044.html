New Jersey</span><span class="text_35">, 530 U.S. 466 (2000). Note that element three should not be submitted if the government has charged a misdemeanor or if it has charged a felony ofense that allegedly occurred after a conviction for another ofense under section 1030. If requested by a party and if supported by the evidence, the court can submit a “greater and lesser included ofense” instruction that would permit separate fndings on the aggravating elements as well as a charge without such fndings (i.e., a misdemeanor). </span></p>
