      <p class="block_23"> Amendments to the Guidelines that became effective November 1, 2009, disaggregated the specific offense characteristic for offenses involving an intent to obtain personal information from seemingly unrelated enhancements for intentionally causing damage to computer systems and for disrupting critical infrastructures. These enhancements were previously contained in a single provision, now enumerated as § 2B1.1(b)(16), which directed application of the “greatest” enhancement, thereby precluding their independent and cumulative application. In the 2009 Guidelines, the enhancement for offenses involving an intent to obtain personal information has been segregated into a new § 2B1.1(b)(15), and combined with an enhancement for disclosures of personal information. </p>

      <p class="block_23"> 2 Section 2B1.1 indicates that “a substantial invasion of a privacy interest” is one valid ground for an upward departure. U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1, cmt. n.19(A)(ii). </p>
