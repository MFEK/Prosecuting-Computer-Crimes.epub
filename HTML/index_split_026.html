      <p class="block_34"><span class="text_52"></span><span class="text_27"> Although </span><span class="text_24">United States v. Drew</span><span class="text_27"> confirms that the government may rely on a website’s terms of service to establish that a website user exceeded her authorization to access the site, the district court also held in that case that the CFAA is unconstitutionally vague to the extent that it permits a defendant to be charged with a misdemeanor violation of § 1030(a)(2)(C) based on a conscious violation of a website’s terms of service. 259 F.R.D. 449, 464 (C.D. Cal. 2009) (“[I]f any conscious breach of a website’s terms of service is held to be sufficient by itself to constitute intentionally accessing a computer without authorization or in excess of authorization, the result will be that section 1030(a)(2)(C) becomes a law ‘that affords too much discretion to the police and too little notice to citizens who wish to use the [Internet].’”). </span><span class="text_29"> </span><span class="text_52"><sup class="calibre33">4</sup></span><span class="text_27"> Note that one author argues that the law would be better of if all “unauthorized access” cases were based only on code-based restrictions, arguing that “contract-based” restrictions are harder to define. Orin S. Kerr, “Cybercrime’s Scope: Interpreting ‘Access’ and ‘Authorization’ in Computer Misuse Statutes,” 78 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 1596 (2003). However, this proposal would essentially read “exceeding authorized access” out of the statute, which the author generally acknowledges. </span><span class="text_24">Id.</span><span class="text_27"> at 1662-63. </span></p>
