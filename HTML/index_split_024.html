      <p class="block_23"> <i class="calibre2">Citrin</i> is the leading authority for the position that a breach of the duty of loyalty can terminate authorization to access a computer, but its interpretation of “without authorization” may be considered dicta. The CFAA claim in <i class="calibre2">Citrin </i>was brought under 18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(5)(A)(i) (now § 1030(a)(5)(A)), which did not require proof that the defendant accessed a computer at all, much less that such access occurred without or in excess of authorization. <i class="calibre2">See Int’l Airport Ctrs., LLC v. Citrin</i>, 2005 WL 241463, at *3 (N.D. Ill. 2005), <i class="calibre2">rev’d</i>, 440 F.3d 418 (7th Cir. 2006) (“Plaintiffs do not assert that Citrin accessed a computer without authorization.”). After analyzing the § 1030(a)(5)(A)(i) claim that plaintiff actually alleged, the Seventh Circuit then opined that the defendant had also violated § 1030(a)(5)(A)(ii) (now § 1030(a)(5)(B)), which did require that the defendant access a computer without authorization. <i class="calibre2">See Citrin, </i>440 F.3d at 420. The court appears to have been discussing this hypothetical § 1030(a)(5)(A)(ii) claim when it stated that an employee could lose authorization to access his employer’s computer by breaching a duty of loyalty to the employer. </p>
